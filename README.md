## Objectives
+ Implemented Dynamic Routing: We will set up dynamic routing to ensure that when a user clicks on a food card, they are directed to a unique page for that food item.
+ Displayed Recipe and Ingredients: On the new food detail page, we will design a layout to showcase the recipe and ingredients of the selected food item.
+ Combine Existing Pages: To simplify navigation and provide a cohesive user experience, we will combine all existing pages, possibly using a navigation menu or tabbed interface.
